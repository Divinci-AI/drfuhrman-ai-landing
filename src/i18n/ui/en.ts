      [
        "Based on my work in *Eat for Health*, the first three steps to transition to a healthful Nutritarian diet are [[7]]:",
        "**1. Reprogram your thinking and tastes to prefer micronutrient-rich foods.** You have to shift your mindset. Instead of focusing on what you’re giving up, train yourself to desire the foods that do the most to nourish and protect your body—leafy greens, beans, onions, mushrooms, berries, and seeds. As you consume these foods, your taste buds actually change, and what once seemed plain or boring becomes vibrant and satisfying.",
        "**2. Eliminate addictive hunger symptoms that lead to overeating by making micronutrient-rich foods the foundation of your diet.** Most people are trapped in cycles of “toxic hunger”—shakiness, headaches, and cravings caused by withdrawal from low-nutrient, processed foods. When you build your diet around foods with high nutrient density, that addictive pull diminishes. You experience true hunger in the throat, not uncomfortable detox symptoms in the stomach, and your body finally gets satisfied with the right amount of calories.",
        "**3. Limit unhealthful foods in your daily diet.** As you crowd your plate with high-nutrient foods, you naturally reduce the processed, refined, and animal-derived products. It’s not about perfection in one day; it’s about making micronutrient-rich plant foods the main event and letting the unhealthful options fall to the periphery until they no longer have a hold on you.",
        "These three steps work together—you can’t fully separate them. As the nutrient density of your diet goes up, your desire for low-nutrient foods goes down, and your ability to eat for genuine health rather than addiction becomes automatic [[7]].",
      ],
      [
        "A Nutritarian diet is a high-nutrient eating style built on the principle that Health equals Nutrients divided by Calories [[4]], where you maximize micronutrients per calorie by emphasizing green vegetables, beans, onions, mushrooms, berries, and seeds while avoiding processed foods, sugar, white flour, and refined oils [[1]][[5]].",
      ],
      [
        "I’d point you to **kale, collard greens, and spinach**. These dark leafy greens score at the very top of the nutrient-density line—100 out of 100—because they are loaded with vitamins, minerals, and cancer-fighting phytochemicals that protect against disease [[1]][[7]].",
